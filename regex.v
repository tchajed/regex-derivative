(** Regex derivatives
 *
 * Regular expression derivatives are a particularly elegant approach
 * to matching and reasoning about regular expressions and
 * languages. The idea is to consider the derivative of a language L
 * (a set of strings) with respect to a character c, defined as {w |
 * cw in L}. In terms of automata, what does the automata match if fed the
 * character c first? It turns out that derivatives of regular languages have
 * two nice properties: the derivative of a regular language is regular, and the
 * derivative of a language expressed as a regular expression can be expressed
 * in a simple syntatic manner.
 *
 * This development defines regexes as syntax and as predicates,
 * defines derivatives syntactically and as a transformation of a
 * predicate, and proves a relationship between these
 * two. Specifically, [[ dr/dc ]] = d [[ r ]]/dc, abusing d/dc for
 * both the syntatic and denotational derivative and using [[ r ]] to
 * denote the denotation of a regex.
 *
 * These derivative tools give a simple and natural regex matcher with a
 * correctness proof in its type.

  (** A string takes elements from the (arbitrary) alphabet above. *)
  Definition string := list Sigma.
  (** A language is traditionally a set of strings. In Coq's constructive logic,
  the best to express (possibly infinite) sets is as a predicate over strings;
  the interpretation will be that forall (l: language) (s: string), l s is true
  for exactly those strings in the language l *)
  Definition language := string -> Prop.

  (** A cool feature of Coq, mirroring standard practice in programming languages papers.

  This command means, for example, that when we use the letter s for a variable
  without a type annotation, it should default to being of type string, before
  types are inferred.

   This might seem like a horrible thing to do, and it is indeed confusing when
   done on a whiteboard or in a paper, but here it serves an important purpose:
   it ensures that when we use the letters c, s, or l (or those characters
   followed by numbers or prime symbols ' actually), they must represent the
   expected type. *)

  | Seq (r1:regex) (r2:regex)
  | Star (r:regex).

  (** Eps is a derived regex that matches only the empty string. *)

  a language. *)

  (** The denotation of a regex is a language.

      Regular expressions give a nice way to think about denotational vs
      operational definitions. We could define what a regular expression does in
      terms of an automata, which gives regexes a meaning operationally.
      Instead, we give a denotation (think "interpretation" or "meaning") for
      each regex, mapping them to a concept we have in our metatheory.

      Normally the metatheory is mathematics, but here we are using the Coq
      programming language as the metatheory. In mathematics we would use a set
      of strings as the denotation of a regex, whereas here we use [language] as
      defined above. *)
